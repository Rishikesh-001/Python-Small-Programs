# 🐍 Python Basics – Learning Repository

This repository contains all the basic Python programs, exercises, and code snippets that I wrote while learning Python from a 9-part YouTube tutorial series. It serves as a personal reference and practice archive for foundational Python concepts.

   - Sets and their properties  
   - Common methods for both

5. **Loops in Python**

   - Range and nested loops

6. **Functions & Recursion in Python**  
   - Defining and calling functions  
   - Arguments, return values  
   - Recursion and base cases

7. **File Input/Output in Python**  
   - Reading from and writing to files

   - Using `with open()` context manager

8. **OOPs in Python (Part 1)**  
   - Classes and Objects  
   - Constructors and `__init__`  
   - Instance and class variables

9. **OOPs in Python (Part 2)**  
   - Inheritance and polymorphism  
   - Method overriding  
   - `super()` function and class hierarchy

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each lecture is saved with organized and readable code for easy navigation. You'll find:

- Program examples discussed in the lecture  
- Practice questions and their solutions  
- Notes or comments explaining logic (where applicable)

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can clone this repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-basics-learning.git
cd python-basics-learning
```
Each topic is self-contained, so feel free to browse and run the .py files independently using:

```bash
python filename.py
```

## 📝 Notes

- This repo is made purely for learning and revision purposes.
- All code is beginner-friendly and written with clarity in mind.

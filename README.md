# 🐍 Python Basics – Learning Repository

This repository contains all the basic Python programs, exercises, and code snippets that I wrote while learning Python from a 9-part YouTube tutorial series. It serves as a personal reference and practice archive for foundational Python concepts.

## 📚 Lecture Topics Covered

Each folder or file corresponds to one lecture in the series. Below is a breakdown of the topics:

1. **Variables and Data Types**  
   - Introduction to Python variables  
   - Data types: int, float, str, bool  
   - Type casting and input/output basics

2. **Conditional Statements**  
   - `if`, `else`, `elif` usage  
   - Nested conditions  
   - Logical operators

3. **List & Tuple in Python**  
   - Creating and modifying lists  
   - List methods and slicing  
   - Tuples and immutability

4. **Dictionary and Set in Python**  
   - Dictionary operations: keys, values, items  
   - Sets and their properties  
   - Common methods for both

5. **Loops in Python**  
   - `for` and `while` loops  
   - Loop control: `break`, `continue`, `pass`  
   - Range and nested loops

6. **Functions & Recursion in Python**  
   - Defining and calling functions  
   - Arguments, return values  
   - Recursion and base cases

7. **File Input/Output in Python**  
   - Reading from and writing to files  
   - Working with file modes (`r`, `w`, `a`, etc.)  
   - Using `with open()` context manager

8. **OOPs in Python (Part 1)**  
   - Classes and Objects  
   - Constructors and `__init__`  
   - Instance and class variables

9. **OOPs in Python (Part 2)**  
   - Inheritance and polymorphism  
   - Method overriding  
   - `super()` function and class hierarchy

Each lecture is saved with organized and readable code for easy navigation. You'll find:

- Program examples discussed in the lecture  
- Practice questions and their solutions  
- Notes or comments explaining logic (where applicable)

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can clone this repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-basics-learning.git
cd python-basics-learning
```
Each topic is self-contained, so feel free to browse and run the .py files independently using:

```bash
python filename.py
```

## 📝 Notes

- This repo is made purely for learning and revision purposes.
- All code is beginner-friendly and written with clarity in mind.
- No external libraries required—standard Python only.
